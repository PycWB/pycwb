Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

PycWB is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pycWB/>`_. You can install it with pip.
Some dependencies are required to be installed before installing pycWB with pip.
The easiest way is to install them with conda.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n pycwb "python>=3.9,<3.11"
   conda activate pycwb
   conda install -c conda-forge root=6.26.10 healpix_cxx=3.81 nds2-client python-nds2-client lalsuite setuptools_scm cmake pkg-config
   python3 -m pip install pycwb


Run your first burst search
---------------------------

In your first burst search, we will use a built-in noise generator and waveform generator
to minimize the requirement for external data. What you need is just one configuration file in YAML format.

To start with, copy the example configuration folder from the source code or download the
``user_parameters_injection.yaml`` manually from `here <https://git.ligo.org/yumeng.xu/pycwb/-/blob/main/examples/injection/user_parameters_injection.yaml>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    cp -r [path_to_source_code]/examples/injection my_first_search

Now, you are all set! You can directly run the example in the terminal with the ``pycwb run`` command

.. code-block:: bash

    pycwb run user_parameters_injection.yaml

Or you can open the juptyer notebook ``pycwb_injection.ipynb`` (download `here <https://git.ligo.org/yumeng.xu/pycwb/-/blob/main/examples/injection/pycwb_injection.ipynb>`_)
and run the search step by step

Command line interfaces (CLI)
------------------------------

It is recommended to use the command line interfaces (CLI) to run the search.
You can get help by running the command with the ``-h`` option. Here are the current available commands:
