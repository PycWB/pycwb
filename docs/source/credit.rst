Use of PycWB in Scientific Publications
============================================

If you use PycWB in a scientific publication, then we ask that you include a citation to the paper
describing the software, as well as a citation to the cWB paper


Citing the PycWB paper
-------------------------

A bibtex key for the PycWB paper is provided below:

.. code-block:: bibtex

    @article{pycwb,
        title = {PycWB: A user-friendly, Modular, and python-based framework for gravitational wave unmodelled search},
        journal = {SoftwareX},
        volume = {26},
        pages = {101639},
        year = {2024},
        issn = {2352-7110},
        doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101639},
        url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711024000104},
        author = {Yumeng Xu and Shubhanshu Tiwari and Marco Drago},
        keywords = {Gravitational waves, Burst search},
        abstract = {Unmodelled searches and reconstruction is a critical aspect of gravitational wave data analysis, requiring sophisticated software tools for robust data analysis. This paper introduces PycWB, a user-friendly and modular Python-based framework developed to enhance such analyses based on the widely used unmodelled search and reconstruction algorithm Coherent Wave Burst (cWB). The main features include a transition from C++ scripts to YAML format for user-defined parameters, improved modularity, and a shift from complex class-encapsulated algorithms to compartmentalized modules. The PycWB architecture facilitates efficient dependency management, better error-checking, and the use of parallel computation for performance enhancement. Moreover, the use of Python harnesses its rich library of packages, facilitating post-production analysis and visualization. The PycWB framework is designed to improve the user experience and accelerate the development of unmodelled gravitational wave analysis.}

Citing the cWB paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should also cite cWB, since pycWB is built on top of cWB. The cWB paper is available at `Phys. Rev. D <https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.042004>`_.

The bibtex key for the cWB paper is provided below:
